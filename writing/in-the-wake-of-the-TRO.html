<h2> In the Wake of the Temporary Restraining Order </h2>

To my students,
<br><br>
You may have noticed I didn't hold office hours last week. I was on the picket line, as the union of TAs, tutors, grad student researchers, postdocs, and research scientists - AKA UAW 4811, previously known as UAW 2865, UAW 5810, and SRU-UAW - was on strike.
<br><br>
We were on strike because the chancellors of the University of California chose to inflict incredible violence on anti-genocide, anti-war-profiteering protesters at UCLA, UCSD, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Cruz. We were on strike because the UC changed "academic freedom of speech" policies to silence those of us speaking out against the genocide of Palestinians. These policies put my colleagues in history, communication, literature, and ethnic studies at risk for disciplinary action just for doing their jobs by discussing the history of Palestine, the rhetoric used by the US and the nation-state of Israel, or in some cases for merely speaking Arabic. We were on strike to demand safety for our Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Jewish colleagues and students. We were on strike to keep our labor from contributing to the military industrial complex.
<br><br>
The University of California <i>twice</i> attempted to get the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to issue an injunction against the strike; PERB, which has jurisdictional authority over relations between the UC and UAW 4811, denied both requests for injunction and filed a complaint against the UC, noting that UAW 4811's unfair labor practice (ULP) filings had merit. In response to PERB's denials of injunctive relief, the UC went to a court in the most conservative county in the state - Orange County - and sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the strike. The TRO was granted on Friday, June 7th; the TRO means that the union must halt strike activity until June 27th - 3 days before spring 2024 contract periods expire, and when the strike was predetermined to end. If you're curious, you can view the legal documentation <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uaw4811.org/2024-ulp-charges">here</a>
<br><br>
UC Irvine law professor Veena Dubal <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/veenadubal/status/1798109232862249346">likens the UC's circumvention of PERB to Starbucks and Amazon's attempts to undermine and circumvent the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</a> as the jurisdictional authority over labor relations in private industry. PERB indeed attended the TRO hearing to object to the UC's circumvention of their authority over the matter; unfortunately, UC chose a judge that didn't care about this violation. This sets a dangerous precedent in labor law: the boss can go judge-shopping, if they don't like the decision made by the jurisdictional authority.

          Note: most on-the-ground cops in these altercations are armed with "less lethal" weapons; this particular cop appears to be cocking a shotgun made for rubber bullets. Despite the "less lethal" moniker, such weapons are deadly at the close range shown in the video, especially when aimed directly at people instead of ricocheted off the ground.

    <h3>What Does UCSD Have to Do with This?</h3>

    You might be saying to yourself "well, this is all fine and good, but what can UCSD do? Khosla can't snap his fingers and create world peace," which, of course, he cannot. What the protests are asking is for universities like UCSD to stop contributing to the military industrial complex (MIC) aiding and abetting the genocide of Palestinians. 
    <br><br>
    Our classmates, colleagues, students, and instructors have done extensive research on the exact nature of UCSD's role in the MIC and how we can undo some of the damage done by UCSD as an agent of the MIC; here are a few highlights:
    <br><br>

    <h4>Complicity Tour</h4>
    You can <a target="_blank" href="https://ion.cesium.com/stories/viewer/?id=59db8cdc-fd53-4c12-a1a1-6b56e831ce78">take a virtual tour of UCSD's collaboration with the Israeli regime</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGHHI0smcg/QdMIzUMX8vW5Q85WMX06sw/view">view the UCSD complicity tour brochure</a>. 
    <br><br>
    One "highlight" includes the Scripps Center for Marine Archaeology and the Center for Cyber-Archaeology, which "[digs] for Iron-Age artifacts meters away from the site of the Tantura Massacre, where between 70 and 140 Palestinians were killed when the village was ethnically cleansed during the 1948 Nakba." You can read about another way that UCSD helps to weaponize archaeology and anthropology against Palestinians in <a target="_blank" href="https://mondoweiss.net/2024/05/uc-san-diego-students-condemn-university-stance/">this Mondoweiss op-ed from a UCSD MD/PhD candidate</a>.

    <h4>Award Explorer</h4>
  In the research funding explorer embedded below, select "Israeli Ministry of Defense" and "Government of Israel" in the "Sponsor" field. You'll find, among other grants, an award to Professor Ryan Kastner of the UCSD Computer Science & Engineering department, for a project entitled "A Practical Approach for Underwater Navigation towards Localizing Underwater Objects", funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Kastner's name has been removed from the award explorer since the beginning of the university encampment wave.
  <br><br>
  You'll also find grant awards from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins, and General Dynamics - defense contractors who manufacture drones and bombs used to kill Palestinians, and who get a say in shaping Jacobs School of Engineering (JSOE) curriculum, as well as special recruiting privileges on our campus, through the <a target="_blank" href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/cap/why-join">JSOE Corporate Affiliates Program</a>

    <h4>UAW 4811 Demands</h4>
    What the university can do, and what UAW 4811 has been asking for, is the following, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uaw4811.org/how-uc-can-engage-with-the-broader-protest-movement">as listed on the union's website</a>:

    <ol>

      <li>
        Amnesty for all academic employees, students, student groups, faculty, and staff who face disciplinary action or arrest due to protest.
        <ul>
          <li>
            This includes 60+ arrestees at UCSD, 120+ at UCSC, 130+ at UCLA, and 50+ at UC Irvine
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Right to free speech and political expression on campus.  
      </li>

      <li>
        Divestment from UC’s known investments in weapons manufacturers, military contractors, and companies profiting from Israel’s war on Gaza. 

        <ul>
          <li>
            To learn more about what this would mean practically, I recommend this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQHFdeJaVJkEo2r4r6bGlYaW08hSv2xDX6Ih0-sUSMplPy1IaGs6SMm6bSeHJ_SXJuGZMT6xJE2Ilat/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g2cf3d1ffbd3_1_3">UC Investments Primer</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            The UC has divested at the behest of student protest in the past, and they're proud to flaunt that, now that it's history. This includes divestment from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/how-students-helped-end-apartheid">South African apartheid</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dailybruin.com/2006/03/19/uc-to-divest-from-sudan-divest">companies aiding the genocide in Sudan</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/ucs-investment-portfolios-fossil-free-clean-energy-investments-top-1-billion">fossil fuels</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Empower researchers to opt out from funding sources tied to the military or oppression of Palestinians. The UC must provide centralized transitional funding to workers whose funding is tied to the military or foundations that support Palestinian oppression.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>What Does Computer Science Have to Do with This?</h3>

    21st century genocides are committed with 21st century tools: artificial intelligence, powered by ubiquitous surveillance. In the case of the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) genocide on Palestinians, AI systems "generate new targets at a faster rate than [the IDF] attacks", turning the Targets Administrative Division into "a mass assassination factory", <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/">as reported by Yuval Abraham for +972 Magazine</a>. The output of these AI target generation systems include both people and buildings, and the categorization of a target by one of these AI systems was treated "as an order, with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice or to examine the raw intelligence data on which it is based" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/">again as reported by Yuval Abraham for +972 Magazine</a>. To feed this killing machine more data, Israel surveils Palestinians everywhere, all the time - by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-can-monitor-every-telephone-call-west-bank-and-gaza-intelligence-source">listening to phone conversations</a> and tracking cell phone signal movements, with license plate readers and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/19/idf-facial-recognition-surveillance-palestinians">facial recognition systems</a>, and even with <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/statement-report/statement-targeting-palestinian-hrds-pegasus">malicious spyware on human rights activists' phones</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/">which isn't just used on Palestinian activists</a>).
    <br><br>
    As Antony Loewenstein wrote in his 2023 book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2684-the-palestine-laboratory">Palestine is a laboratory where new technologies of repression are developed.</a> The tools of technofascism, once tested, are then <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.torproject.org/surveillance-as-a-service-global-impact-of-israeli-defense-technologies-on-privacy-human-rights/">exported everywhere</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/08/25/border-patrol-israel-elbit-surveillance/">the United States' southern border</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/corsight-ai-receives-top-rankings-in-2020-biometric-technology-rally-conducted-by-the-department-of-homeland-security-301225577.html">Department of Homeland Security</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/abu-dhabi-announces-launch-israeli-installed-mass-surveillance-system">Abu Dhabi</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kppna/california-police-used-military-surveillance-tech-at-grad-student-strike">grad student strikes at our very own sister schools</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/attending-gaza-protests-the-feds">current protests against all of the killing</a>. This isn't a one-way street, to be clear - both <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@notechforapartheid/a-marriage-made-in-hell-an-introduction-to-microsofts-complicity-in-apartheid-and-genocide-d7dfad65a196">Microsoft</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/12/google-amazon-workers-condemn-project-nimbus-israeli-military-contract">Amazon, and Google</a> sell AI and cloud computing services, as well as access to data from services like Google Photos, to the Israeli regime.
    <br><br>
    To say it plainly: <b>members of our field - computer science - are building tools that systematically undermine human rights and enable killing on an unprecedented mass scale</b>. This should be offensive to any and all of our senses of professional ethics, in the same way as a doctor who advises a torturer betrays the Hippocratic Oath, or a civil engineer who builds a bridge in a way that will kill people betrays the responsibilities of her PE license.
    <br><br>
    This is not the first time or the only way that computer scientists have aided or abetted genocide; that history includes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/04/hitlers-willing-business-partners/303146/">IBM supplying the Nazis with computers used to identify targets for the Holocaust in the 1930s</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/">Facebook's algorithmic promotion of violence against Rohingya</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/apple-google-microsoft-dell-tesla-named-lawsuit-deaths/story?id=67795965#:~:text=Apple%2C%20Dell%2C%20Google%2C%20Microsoft,who%20are%20described%20as%20either">the role of the consumer tech market's demand for cobalt in the Congo</a>. In the future, we face the human cost of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/">power-hungry datacenters needing more and more water</a>. Every time, the tech industry has refused accountability, choosing instead to dress up further expansions in greenwashed language of "decarbonization".
    <br><br>
    The buck stops here, with me. I refuse to avert my eyes from the violence that our field enables. I dove into the field of computer security to help keep people safe, whether that's from doxxing, hackers, cops, bad governments, or abusive partners. I cannot practice computer security as care work if I am ignoring the atrocities manufactured by our colleagues. Beyond that, I have a duty to my fellow human beings to fight tooth and nail for a practice of computer science that is based in compassion and moderation. I hope you - my students, colleagues, and neighbors - will join me in that pursuit, because none of us can do it alone. I'd recommend checking out <a target="_blank" href="https://notechforapartheid.com/">No Tech for Apartheid</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://scienceforthepeople.org/">Science for the People</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://linktr.ee/researchers_against_war">Researchers Against War</a>
