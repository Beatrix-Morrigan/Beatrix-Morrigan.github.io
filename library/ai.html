    <h2>A Critical Perspective On AI &amp; Machine Learning </h2>

    <p>I am skeptical of whether "AI" in its current form - especially "generative AI" - is good for much (Linus Torvalds - known as the creator of the Linux kernel and the git version control system, two technologies foundational to modern software -<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/29/linus_torvalds_ai_hype/" target="_blank">is skeptical too</a>).

    <blockquote>
        Booming demand for AI-enabled military technologies and cloud computing services is being driven by several developments. Perhaps most importantly, <strong>the easy availability of massive amounts of digital data</strong> collected from satellites, drones, surveillance cameras, smartphones, social media posts, email messages, and other sources has motivated Pentagon planners to find new ways of analyzing the information. This, <strong>coupled with years of 'AI hype'</strong> generated by tech leaders, venture capitalists, and business reporters among others, has played a crucial role in <strong>sparking the interest of military leaders who have come to view Silicon Valley’s newest innovations as indispensable warfighting tools.</strong> [...] This report dispels the common myth that Silicon Valley has been reluctant to do business with the Pentagon due to a so-called 'cultural divide.' As we shall see, the DoD has awarded large, multiyear contracts—some worth tens of billions of dollars—to the tech industry over the past decade. <strong>A conservative estimate indicates that U.S. military and intelligence agencies awarded $28 billion to Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google’s parent company) between 2018 and 2022.</strong>

'<strong>Large parts of the public are not particularly interested in generative AI</strong>, and 30% of people in the UK say they have not heard of any of the most prominent products, including ChatGPT,' Dr Fletcher said.

<h3>What's the Takeaway Here?</h3>

<p>
    In my professional and personal opinion, "AI" hasn't yet been developed into a rigorous or sustainable tool. Perhaps it *could* be, with more research and refinement, but I can't recommend or engage with its current iteration, as I understand that it would be deleterious to the quality of my work and my comprehension of the systems my work pertains to, on top of my ethical objections to its current form.
