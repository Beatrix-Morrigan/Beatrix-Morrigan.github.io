                    During pickets and rallies, Cruz, who frequently led rallies in front of a megaphone, said police officers approached him reciting his full name, date of birth, and hometown in what felt like an attempt to intimidate him.

                    Following repeated claims by a university board of trustee member that outside entities were funding and orchestrating the encampments, [New Jersey Democrat Representative Josh] Gottheimer said that he had been in touch with the FBI on the matter.

                    “Based on my conversations with the FBI,” Gottheimer, who is a member of the Intelligence Committee said, “I can just say that I think people are well aware this is an issue.” 
                    <br><br>
                    Gottheimer added: “I can’t speak for the local FBI field offices, but it’s got to be all hands on deck.”
