                    Gaza Funds is a project that connects people to crowdfunding campaigns for individuals and families from Gaza. Each time the page is reloaded, a different campaign appears. While the rotation is randomized, campaigns for the sick/injured and campaigns close to meeting their goals are prioritized

                    The infrastructure needed to access the Internet in Gaza has been destroyed by bombing and the Israeli government has blocked access. eSIMs are virtual SIM cards which allow people to connect to the outside world, to communicate with their families, show what’s happening in Gaza and to get an education. Over 300,000 eSIMs have been donated, with many people able to connect through one eSIM.

            <p>
            Who Profits Research Center is an independent research center dedicated to exposing the commercial involvement of Israeli and international corporations in the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Syrian land and population.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our work addresses the Israeli occupation economy and sheds light on the role of the private sector in the Israeli settlement enterprise, in the economic exploitation of Palestinian and Syrian land, labor, and resources, as well as its role in the apparatus of control exerted over occupied populations.
        </p>
        <p> 
            We recognize that private corporations globally play a major role in advancing political interests while generating enormous profits. Similarly, the Israeli and multinational corporations facilitating and profiting from Israel's military repression, settlement expansion, and the exploitation of resources and labor are significant actors in a global economic system and should be confronted as such. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Moreover, Israeli companies and the Israeli security apparatus are constantly developing technologies and mechanisms of control and repression that are tested and actualized on Palestinian bodies. These technologies and practices are then exported globally to forge political alliances.
        </p>
        <p> 
            We consider knowledge a powerful tool for exposing the underlying causes and mechanisms of injustice. By producing fact-based, free, and accessible research and analysis on the economic aspects of Israel’s entrenched rule over the Palestinian people and the Syrian communities of the Golan, we support the work of the global civil society for justice, freedom, and equality in Palestine and beyond. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Who Profits was founded in 2007 as a project of the Coalition of Women for Peace, and became an independent Research Center in 2013.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Since the outbreak of Israel’s war in Gaza following Hamas’ terrorist attack on October 7, more than 100 journalists and media workers have been killed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the Gaza Project, 50 journalists from 13 different news organizations worked together to investigate the killing of journalists in Gaza and the alleged threats, targeting arrests made in the West Bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                From targeted attacks to the destruction of infrastructure known to host media outlets, the Gaza Project reveals a damning array of evidence against the Israeli government and calls into question their army’s denials about targeting the press since the war began.
